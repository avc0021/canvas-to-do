# Overview:
Will need to reset account in Dev environment and double check api keys after every 3rd Saturday of the month. To do this reach out to Andy Chavez via Teams to reset account. Sometimes he forgets, but make sure you have set up as a Admin otherwise API calls will not work. In production this is not needed.
